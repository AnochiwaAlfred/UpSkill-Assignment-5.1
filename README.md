# UpSkill-Assignment-5

The **assignment5.js** file is the full assignment, if it were to be run on node or tested using the console.



I have designed a simple page that can collect inputs for each question and provide the required solution via DOM manipulation using the code written in **_forIndex.js_**.
This code is identical to the one in **assignment5.js**, except the input and output methods.
While the **assignment5.js** takes input parameters when the functions are called and outputs to the console, the **_forIndex.js_** takes input from HTML input elemets in the **_index.html_** file, and displays the results in the same page.
